/*
  Basic Set 1.3: Searching for an object in an array
    Given a name (string) and an array of people (objects), 
    find the person with the given name and return his/her hobby. 
    Return false if there is no person with the given name.
  DO NOT use people.find()
  DO use a for loop.
  TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after you’ve solved it using a for loop.
Examples
  Input	
    name: "Alice"
    people: [ { "name": "Alice", "hobby": "programming" }, { "name": "Bob", "hobby": "gaming" } ]
  Output:
    'programming'
