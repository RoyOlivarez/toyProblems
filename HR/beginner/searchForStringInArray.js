/*
Basic Set 1.1: Searching for a string in an array
  Given a string and an array of strings, return true if the string exists in the array, and false if it does not.
  DO NOT use .includes() in your solution.
  DO use a for loop.
  TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after you’ve solved it using a for loop.
